## Results

Through the analysis we can notice a clear difference between each city type, this difference is more notable between Urbal and Rural cities since the Urban cities have more amount of drivers and more number of rides, this is maybe the reason why the fare on this kind of cities is lower compared to rural areas,and here is included the supply-demand factor, in urban areas we can find a higher concentration of people than in suburban and rural cities. Another factor that we should consider in the travel distance between rural and urban cities this could be another reason why the fares in rural cities is higher because the distances could be greater than in urban areas

In the following graph we can see that the fare in each month is greater for urban cities that in suburban and rural areas, this is related to the demand for travel in each of these cities, and here we can see clearly the supply-demand factor, even though the fare in the rural zones are higher the number of people that needs this kind of services are few.
