# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis 

This project has the main object to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 from PyBer a ride-sharing app company. Our main purpose is analyze the behavior between the different type of cities in our case the types of cities we will be working will be Urban, Suburban and Rural in relation to the number of drivers and the fares. With the above Pyber company could take the best decisionÂ for the business strategy.

## Results

Through the analysis we can notice a clear difference between each city type, this difference is more notable between Urbal and Rural cities since the Urban cities have more amount of drivers and more number of rides, this is maybe the reason why the fare on this kind of cities is lower compared to rural areas,and here is included the supply-demand factor, in urban areas we can find a higher concentration of people than in suburban and rural cities. Another factor that we should consider in the travel distance between rural and urban cities this could be another reason why the fares in rural cities is higher because the distances could be greater than in urban areas

Note that for this ride-sharing chart the size of the bubbles correletes with driver count per city, at the same time we can see that the rural cities has fewer drivers compared with urbal and suburban areas.

In the following graph we can see that the fare in each month is greater for urban cities that in suburban and rural areas, this is related to the demand for travel in each of these cities, and here we can see clearly the supply-demand factor, even though the fare in the rural zones are higher the number of people that needs this kind of services are few.

## Summary

As we can see through our analysis the different between the different kind of cities in our dataset is very evident through the number of driver, the highest fares and number of rides in the rural and suburban areas compared to rural areas, to reduce this differences we can do the following strategies:

1. Give access to preferential fares for rural cities to stimulate increased demand, this could be a good option if we consider the probability that the trajectories could are longer that in the rural areas

2. Launch promotional campaigns for rural and suburban cities in which you can ofter diferent payment methods in case that people do not have access to a credit card, this 
could be one of the reasons because people that lives in this kind of cities don't use this ride-sharing apps.

3. Increase the number of drivers in the rural and suburban areas if there is a greater demand, because the wait time is important variable that people consider at the moment to take this ride-sharing services through an app.
